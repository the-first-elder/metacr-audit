Security Audit Report for StorageVictim Contract:

1. Uninitialized Pointer:
   The contract uses an uninitialized pointer `Storage str` in the `store` function, which points to the storage address 0 (owner). This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities. An attacker may exploit this uninitialized pointer to manipulate data or gain unauthorized access.

Suggested Fix:
To address this issue, initialize the `Storage` struct directly in the `store` function and assign the values to `storages[msg.sender]`. Here's the updated code:

```solidity
function store(uint256 _amount) public {
    storages[msg.sender] = Storage(msg.sender, _amount);
}
```

2. Overides user info:
   This overides user info if they call the contract more than once..

   ```solidity
    str.amount = _amount;
   ```

   it should be

   ```solidity
   str.amount += _amount;
   ```

3. State Variables Visibility:
   The `owner` variable is defined as `address` but lacks a visibility specifier. In Solidity 0.8.18, state variables must explicitly declare their visibility to prevent unintended access or modification.

Suggested Fix:
Declare the `owner` variable as `immutable` if it should only be accessed within the contract:

```solidity
address immutable owner;
```

```solidity
mapping(address => Storage) storages;
```

By implementing the suggested fixes, the contract will have improved security and compatibility with Solidity 0.8.18, addressing the identified issues and reducing potential vulnerabilities.
